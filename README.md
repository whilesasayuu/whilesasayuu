- 👋 Hi, I’m @whilesasayuu
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, more specifically in web and app design
- 🍰 I’m currently learning because of college this year we started with Scheme-Racket (an interpreter of Lisp) for functional programming; another languague i been learning is c++ since first year at college and now too for objets.
  Beside from that i want to continue to learn C# and Phyton, which i was learning by myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project i can take on in the future, to be able to built my own portafolio.
